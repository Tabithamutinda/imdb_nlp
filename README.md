Sentiment Analysis on Movie Reviews
This dataset contains two columns: review and sentiment. 
The review column includes text data (movie reviews), and the sentiment column labels each review as either "positive" or "negative." 
The main aim is to develop a model that can predict positive or negative reviews of different movie sentiments.
